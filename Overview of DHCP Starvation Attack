Overview of DHCP Starvation Attack

A DHCP Starvation Attack is a type of denial-of-service (DoS) attack that targets the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) server within a network. DHCP is responsible for automatically assigning IP addresses and other network configuration details (like the gateway and DNS) to devices as they join the network. This process allows devices to communicate with each other on the network without manual configuration.

In a DHCP starvation attack, a malicious attacker floods the DHCP server with an overwhelming number of DHCP requests. These requests are often sent using spoofed or fake MAC addresses to impersonate multiple devices. As a result, the DHCP server is forced to allocate IP addresses from its pool to these fake requests, quickly depleting the available IP address range.

When the DHCP server runs out of available IP addresses, legitimate devices attempting to join the network cannot obtain an IP address. This leads to network disruptions where authorized users are unable to communicate, causing service outages and downtime.

Additionally, an attacker may not only exhaust the DHCP server's IP address pool but could also inject malicious DHCP responses, further destabilizing the network and potentially redirecting traffic or causing additional damage.

This attack demonstrates a serious vulnerability in the network infrastructure, particularly in environments that rely heavily on DHCP for dynamic address allocation. If left unmitigated, DHCP starvation can significantly degrade a networkâ€™s performance, making it a critical threat to network availability and security.

Tools Typically Used for DHCP Starvation Attacks

DHCPig: A popular tool for conducting DHCP starvation attacks by sending a large number of DHCP requests.

Metasploit Framework: Can be used to exploit DHCP vulnerabilities in a network.

Custom Scripts: Attackers often write their own scripts in Python or Bash to automate the DHCP request flooding process.


Potential Impacts of DHCP Starvation

1. Service Outages: Devices fail to obtain IP addresses and cannot access the network, causing downtime.


2. Network Instability: The DHCP server may become overwhelmed, leading to slow or unreliable network services.


3. Loss of Availability: Legitimate users and devices may lose access to critical network resources.



This attack is particularly concerning in large networks where DHCP is widely used and has limited capacity for handling numerous requests. It also highlights the importance of securing DHCP servers and implementing preventive measures to safeguard network infrastructure.
